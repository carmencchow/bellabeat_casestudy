<h1>Bellabeat Case Study  üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚åö</h1>
<p>Carmen Chow</p> 
<p>September 2024</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.  Founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.  Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. Sr≈°en knows that an analysis of Bellabeat‚Äôs available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.</p>

<h2>Stakeholders</h2>

*  Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en: Bellabeat‚Äôs cofounder and Chief Creative Officer

*  Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat‚Äôs cofounder</p>

*  Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat‚Äôs marketing strategy. 

<h2>Ask</h2>
<h3><b>Business Task</b></h3>
Analyze smart device fitness data to gain insights into trends that can be applied to Bellabeat customers. 

<h2>Prepare</h2>

<h3><b>Data Source</b></h3>
We will look at publicly available Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data from 30 Fitbit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data. The data points include daily physical activity, step count, calories burned, and hours slept. The dataset, provided under the Mobius license, consists of 18 wide format CSV files of anonymized user information. Link to data: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit .

<h3><b>Data Bias and Credibility. Does it ROCCC?</b></h3>

*  <b>R</b>eliable - Low; the data is from only 30 participants

*  <b>O</b>riginal - Low; the data was collected by a third-party provider, Amazon Mechanical Turk
  
*  <b>C</b>omprehensive - Medium, various data points unavailable (e.g. fitness level, age, gender ...)
  
*  <b>C</b>urrent - Low; the data is from April to May 2016, making it over 8 years old.

* <b>C</b>ited - Low; the dataset is available via Mobius on Kaggle
          
<h3><b>Data Limitations</b></h3>

*  Some data sets have a small sample size of 33 Fitbit users, while the weight data has an even smaller sample size of 8.
  
*  The data is over 8 years old and therefore no longer current.
  
*  Details on how long participants wore their Fitbit throughout the day are missing.

*  Key information, such as the age, gender, and overall health of the participants, is also missing.

<h3><b>R packages and libraries</b></h3>
<p>We‚Äôll be using R for our data analysis and data visualization. Let‚Äôs start by installing and running the following R packages: 

```
# install packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("lubridate")

# run packages
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
```

Out of the 18 available files, we‚Äôll focus on 3. The remaining files either contain information outside the scope of the Business Task or duplicate data that is already found in `dailyActivity_merged.csv`.

```
dailyActivity_merged.csv
sleepDay_merged.csv
weightLogInfo_merged.csv

```

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
In R Studio, we'll read and save each CSV file as a data frame:

```
dailyActivity_merged <- read_csv("C:/Users/carme/OneDrive/Desktop/TurkFitBit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
sleepDay_merged <- read_csv("C:/Users/carme/OneDrive/Desktop/TurkFitBit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weightLogInfo_merged <- read_csv("C:/Users/carme/OneDrive/Desktop/TurkFitBit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```

We'll use `ls()` to check that the files have been correctly imported into the environment pane of R Studio. Then, we'll use `head()` to return the first few rows of each data frame. Here are the ones from the `sleepDay_merged` data: 

```
          Id SleepDay              TotalSleepRecords TotalMinutesAsleep TotalTimeInBed
       <dbl> <chr>                             <dbl>              <dbl>          <dbl>
1 1503960366 4/12/2016 12:00:00 AM                 1                327            346
2 1503960366 4/13/2016 12:00:00 AM                 2                384            407
3 1503960366 4/15/2016 12:00:00 AM                 1                412            442
4 1503960366 4/16/2016 12:00:00 AM                 2                340            367
5 1503960366 4/17/2016 12:00:00 AM                 1                700            712
6 1503960366 4/19/2016 12:00:00 AM                 1                304            320
```

We'll use `colnames()` to view the column headers to check if there are any formatting issues that need to be addressed. We can see that column names in the `weightLogInfo_merged` data frame need to be changed from camel case to snake case to align with R‚Äôs naming conventions.

```> colnames(weightLogInfo_merged)
[1] "Id"             "Date"           "WeightKg"       "WeightPounds"   "Fat"           
[6] "BMI"            "IsManualReport" "LogId"  
```

Each Fitbit should have a unique `id`. Let's see if that's the case. 

```
activity_ids <- n_distinct(dailyActivity_merged$Id)
print(activity_ids)
[1] 33

sleep_ids <- n_distinct(sleepDay_merged$Id)
print(sleep_ids)
[1] 24

weight_ids <- n_distinct(weightLogInfo_merged$Id)
print(weight_ids)
[1] 8
```

We have 33 users in the dailyActivity data frame, 24 in the sleepDay one, and only 8 in the weightLogInfo data frame. Due to the smaller sample size of the last data frame, we will not use it moving forward to avoid sampling bias.

Below is a summary of the data cleansing we'll conduct to clean and transform our raw, unclean data.

<h3><b>Data Cleaning</b></h2>

*  Use the `clean_names()` function to format column names to snake_case.

```
daily_activity <- clean_names(dailyActivity_merged)
daily_sleep <- clean_names(sleepDay_merged)
```
          
*  Use `as_Date()` function to format dates from a string data type to a Date object. Use `weekdays()` to extract the day of the week and assign it to a new variable named `weekday`. Use the `ordered()` function to create an ordered factor to order the days chronologically instead of alphabetically.</p>

```
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  rename(date = activity_date) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>%
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(date)) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = ordered(weekday, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday","Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")))
```

*  Split the `sleep_day column` into `hour` and `date` columns.

```
daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  separate(sleep_day, c("date", "hour"),sep = "^\\S*\\K") %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
```

*  Add a new `min_fall_asleep`  column that calculates the time it takes for participants to fall asleep by subtracting `total_minutes_asleep` from `total_time_in_bed`.

```
daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  mutate( 
    min_fall_asleep = total_time_in_bed - total_minutes_asleep
  )
```
*  Use `distinct()` and `drop_na()` functions to remove duplicate rows and NA values.

```
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()
```
*  Exclude records that show 0 calories burned and 0 steps taken because participants forgot to wear their tracker that day. 

```
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  filter(calories > 0 & total_steps > 0)
```

<br>

After processing our data, we are now ready to merge the data frames to better understand the relationships between different dimensions such as sleep, activity level, and total steps. We'll perform a `merge()` based on the common `id` and `date` columns. This will be a left join, resulting in the inclusion of all the rows from the `daily_activity` data frame and only the matching rows from the `daily_sleep` data frame.

```
daily_df <-
  merge(
    x = daily_activity, 
    y = daily_sleep,
    by = c ("id", "date"),
    all.x = TRUE
  )
```

<h2>Analyze & Share </h2>

Let's run the `summary()` function to get an overview of our new dataset‚Äôs distribution:

<br>

<i><b>Key takeaways:</b></i>

*  <b>8,319</b> - the average number of steps taken per day. This number falls below the recommended 10,000 steps. Moreover, the 1st Qu. results show that 25% of participants averaged less than 4,923 steps a day.

*  <b>5.98</b> kilometers - the average distance walked per day. 

*  <b>210.0</b> - the average number of minutes being lightly active  

*  <b>14.78</b> - the average number of minutes being fairly active 

*  <b>23.02</b> - the average number of minutes being very active 

*  <b>15.9 hours</b> (or 955.8 minutes) - the average time spent sedentary.

*  <b>2,361</b> - the average number of calories burned per day, which equates to approximately 98.3 calories burned per hour.

<br>

We‚Äôll use the installed `ggplot2` package to create visualization of our data that will help us determine if there are positive or negative relationships between different variables. 

<br>

<p><i><b>i) Physical Activity (Step Count)</b></i></p>
Let‚Äôs take a look at the relationship between daily step count and daily calories burned. 
<br>
<p>

![calories](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d77ea900-2d68-4e6d-9a6f-3674a9428630)

As expected, the chart shows a strong positive correlation between calorie expenditure and step count. This supports the recommendation to walk 10,000 steps a day due to its calorie-burning benefits. Next, let's examine whether the day of the week impacts our participants‚Äô total daily step count.</p>

```
steps_by_day <- daily_df %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(steps = sum(total_steps)) %>%
  arrange(desc(steps))
print(steps_by_day)
```
Tuesday appears to be the day when Fitbit users walked the most. 

```
  weekday     steps
  <ord>       <dbl>
1 Tuesday   1235001
2 Wednesday 1133906
3 Thursday  1088658
4 Saturday  1010969
5 Friday     938477
6 Monday     933704
7 Sunday     838921
```
<br>

Let's take a look at calories burned throughout the week. We would expect the order of the days to be identical or fairly similar to the days that had the highest step counts. In fact, with the exception of Tuesday, they aren‚Äôt. This is likely because calories burned is an aggregate of several factors: calories burned through physical activity (including steps walked and non-step activities like swimming or weight training), calories burned while performing basic funcions (Basal Metabolic Rate), and calories burned through non-exercise activity thermogenesis, such as fidgeting. 

![avcals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a700a3c-5b31-4887-9330-44074d9063b9)

<br>
Although the average calories burned don't vary much from day to day, the data shows a slight increase in calorie expenditure on Tuesday and Saturday. At this point, we'll bring in the `hourlySteps_merged.csv` file to investigate any hourly trends and determine when users are most active. We‚Äôll create a data frame and perform the same data cleansing steps outlined in the <b>Process</b> section of this analysis. We see that the `hourlySteps_merged` data frame also includes `33 id`s. Let's examine the data frame's first 6 rows.

```
          id activity_hour         step_total
       <dbl> <chr>                      <dbl>
1 1503960366 4/12/2016 12:00:00 AM        373
2 1503960366 4/12/2016 1:00:00 AM         160
3 1503960366 4/12/2016 2:00:00 AM         151
4 1503960366 4/12/2016 3:00:00 AM           0
5 1503960366 4/12/2016 4:00:00 AM           0
6 1503960366 4/12/2016 5:00:00 AM           0
```

We'll perform an additional cleaning step using the `separate()` function to split the `activity_hour` column into two separate columns: `date` and `hour`.  

```
           id date      hour           step_total
        <dbl> <chr>     <chr>               <dbl>
 1 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 12:00:00 AM"        373
 2 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 1:00:00 AM"         160
 3 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 2:00:00 AM"         151
 4 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 3:00:00 AM"           0
 5 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 4:00:00 AM"           0
 6 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 5:00:00 AM"           0
 7 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 6:00:00 AM"           0
 8 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 7:00:00 AM"           0
 9 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 8:00:00 AM"         250
10 1503960366 4/12/2016 " 9:00:00 AM"        1864
```

Now, we'll take a look at the distribution of total steps taken among the 33 participants. There are over 90 records of users getting the recommended 10,000 daily steps between 2016-04-12 and 2016-05-12. Graphing the frequency of steps taken results in a right-skewed graph due to a number of participants who took more than the average number of steps on certain days, with one participant's tracker recording nearly 36,000 steps in a single day, which is more three times the recommended number.

![stepcount](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caaa6899-74a3-4779-843c-bab3b102c2bd)

Despite the high step counts from these highly active participants, 50% of participants got fewer than 8,319 steps a day, which is below the recommended daily step count of 10,000 steps.

Let's see when participants are walking the most during the day. We‚Äôll use the `summarize()` and `arrange()` functions to order the daily average steps from highest to lowest to find peak hours of activity:


```
avg_steps <- hourly_steps %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarize(avg_steps = mean(step_total)) %>%
  mutate(avg_steps = as.integer(avg_steps)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_steps)) 
```

<br>

We see that the highest average step count was between 5pm and 7pm, peaking at 6 pm with 599 average steps. The next period of high step count happens in the afternoon between 12 and 2 pm. 


<br>

![steps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0ca58e4-d9d4-44c7-8125-d3f841aee601)

<i><b>ii) Physical Activity (Moderate to Vigorous Activity)</b></i>
<p>Let‚Äôs shift our focus to physical activity levels and their effect on the total number of calories burned per day. 
          
<br>

![very](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d294861-b0e4-4a90-8c07-badbf67ebf80)

<br>

![lightly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6801e5d2-43b6-454e-b85d-ec6a363f7025)

<br>

![sed_cals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc00bd6e-0be0-4e65-b9fd-2532a71bde11)

<br>

Beginning with the first scatterplot, we see a strong positive correlation between minutes of vigorous activity and total calories burned. We can expect people who spend more time participating in vigorous activity to burn more calories throughout the day. Although  the correlation is not as strong, a positive relationship also exists for light activities. Surprisingly, the correlation between sedentary minutes and calories burned only appears negative after 1,000 minutes of sedentary activity.

Since the WHO‚Äôs recommendation calls for <b>150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week</b>, we'll create a `moderate_vigorous_minutes` variable that combines fairly active and very active minutes.  We‚Äôll plot a histogram to show the frequency of moderate to vigorous minutes over the span of a month and review the updated summary statistics to include this new column. 

```  
 very_active_minutes moderate_vigorous_minutes
 Min.   :  0.00      Min.   :  0.00           
 1st Qu.:  0.00      1st Qu.:  0.00           
 Median :  7.00      Median : 26.00           
 Mean   : 23.02      Mean   : 37.79           
 3rd Qu.: 35.00      3rd Qu.: 61.00           
 Max.   :210.00      Max.   :275.00
```

![modvig](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/711ab08c-e267-4708-ab8e-852adc4b7bde)

We see a worryingly high count of participants recording 0 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity on <b>300 occasions</b>. Given that our data covers 33 participants over 4 weeks, this equates to roughly <b>one-third of the month!</b>

```
33 participants x 7 days a week x 4 weeks = 924 total occasions in a month

300/924 x 100 = 32.47%
```

Our right-skewed histogram shows several occasions when participants had <i>hours</i> of moderate to vigorous activity in a single day. However, the histogram also tells us that 50% of the participants had 26 minutes or less of moderate to vigorous activity, with the average time being 37.8 minutes. 

<br>
<b><i>iii) Sedentary Behavior</i></b>
<p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at the distribution of sedentary minutes in a day. The median is 1,021 minutes, which means 50% of participants are sedentary for at least 17.02 hours. The majority of participants seem to be spend between 600 and 1,200 minutes (or 10 to 20 hours) being inactive.</p>

![sedentary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ccbf2d-b4a4-46fc-95d9-e1265d9b1e6e)

<b><i>iv) Sleep</i></b>
<p>
Let‚Äôs see what the data tells us about our participants' sleep patterns and determine if they are getting the recommended 7 or more hours of sleep. We‚Äôll use the  `summary()` function again to get an overview of the distribution of sleep times from our `daily_df` data frame. 
</p>

```

```
<i>Key takeaways</i> 
*  <b>6.9 hours</b> (or 419.5 minutes) - the average sleep time.
*  <b>39.17 minutes</b> - the average time needed to fall asleep.
*  <b>25%</b> of participants are sleeping <b>6 hours</b> or less (361 minutes or less). 
*  The shortest sleep time recorded was 58 minutes while the highest was 796 minutes.

The National Sleep Foundation recommends 7 to 9 hours of sleep for young adults and adults. The histogram aboves shows that 50% of participants are getting 7.2 hours (432.5 minutes) or more of sleep. However, half of the participants are not getting the recommended minimum, while some are sleeping more than 9 hours. Participants tend to sleep longer on weekends and Wednesdays.

Let's examine the impact of different activity levels on total minutes of sleep through the following four scatterplots:

We see that sedentary minutes negatively impact sleep duration: more time spent being inactive results in less time spent asleep. Conversely, sleep duration improves with more time spent engaging in moderately active and very active activities. 

<h3><b>Final Summary</b></h3>

*  50% of participants take fewer than 8,053 steps per day and 25% take fewer than 4,923.
*  50% of participants sleep less than 7.2 hours a day.
*  50% of participants are sedentary for more than 15.9 hours a day.
*  50% of participants get less than 26 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a day
* For about one-third of the month, participants recorded 0 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity

<p>Before making recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy, we should remind ourselves of the limitations presented by this non-ROCCC dataset. Moving forward, Bellabeat should aim to collect first-party data provided by actual customers and encourage their customers to wear their fitness tracker consistently.          
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
  
<b>AI Integration & Health Reporting</b>
Introduce an AI feature in Bellabeat's Leaf and Tracker app that can help users set personalized goals, answer health questions, intepret health data, and recommend personalized workouts based on their health data and goals. Users can interacat work with the AI to set and suggest workout, make recommendations and modifications to their plans etc. The AI can be relied on to perform coaching, reporting, motivate. Weekly progress reports and scores that measure improvement from week to week across key metrics such as calories burned, hours asleep, step count, and minutes of moderate-vigorous activity.

<b>Built-in Workouts</b>
Bellabeat can introduce moderate to high-intensity workouts designed to help all users reach their daily fitness goals. Bellabeat should communicate to their customers the importance of limiting the number of sedentary hours and increasing the minutes of moderate to vigorous activity so they are meeting the recommended 150-300 minutes every week. Bellabeat can introduce short workouts with the messaging "Every Move Counts" in reference to the World Health Organization's Every Move Counts initiative.

<b>Special Features</b>
To incentive users, Bellabeat users who meet their daily step count or their 150-300 minutes of daily moderate-vigorous exercise can unlock exclusive features or be invited to participate in virtual fitness challenges. Dynamic leaderboards where users can see their progres in real time. 

<b>Notifications and Reminders</b>
High sedentary behaviour was observed in over half of the sample population for a third of the month. Bellabeat should communicate the dangers of prolonged sedentary activity and should implement a notification that alerts users when no activity has been detected for a set amount of time. Alerts can communicate to participants how many steps they still need to reach their goal

By incorporating these recommendations into Bellabeat's marketing strategy, Uksena nd her team can
